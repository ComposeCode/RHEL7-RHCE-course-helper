# Chapter 6, Section 1: Sharing Block Storage with iSCSI

### What is iSCSI ?

iSCSI is a storage networking protocol used to a share a computer's local storage with remote clients using the SCSI commandset over an existing IP network infrastructure. The clients see the shared storage as a locally attached hard disk and can use any available disk and file system management tools to partition, format and mount it. This way, unused storage on one system can be utilized by other systems without the need of physically relocating it or reorganizing cables.
