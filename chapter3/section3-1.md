# Chapter 2, Section 1: Configuring Bonding, Teaming, IPv6, and Routing

This chapter covers Network Time Protocol (NTP). We will cover the NTP protocol, time sources, NTP roles and stratum levels. We will also cover the NTP packages, tooling and the configuration files.

Network Time Protocol (known as NTP) is used to maintain the clock on the system and keeps it synchronized with a more accurate and reliable time source. Providing an accurate source of time is important for time sensitive applications, such as monitoring software, backup tools, scheduling utilities, billing systems, file sharing protocols and authentication programs (including TSL/SSL) to perform correctly and precisely.  Other services for logging and are also aided by accurate time as they have accurate time stamps inside their log files/alerts.
