# Chapter 3, Section 1: IPv6

As the pool of IPv4 IP addresses has been exhausted, IPv6 is the next necessary step in meeting future demand. IPv6 is enabled in RHEL7 by default for all standalone and logical interfaces unless it is manually disabled.

IPv6 is a 128-bit software address providing access to 2^128 addresses, which is approximately 340 undecilion (340 followed by 36 zeros) addresses. This is an extremely large IP space which should last for a very long time.

Unlike IPv4 addresses which contain 4 dot separated octets, IPv6 addresses contain eight colon-separated groups of four hexadecimal numbers.

## Configuring IPv6

IPv6 addresses can be assigned through GUI utilities, Network Manager tools, using the ip command, the Network Settings tool and the Network Connections tool. Entries can also be made manually in the configuration files within /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts.
